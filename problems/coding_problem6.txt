There's a staircase with N steps, and you can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a
function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps
matters.

What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from a
set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a
time. Generalize your function to take in X.
